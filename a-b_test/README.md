# Hypotheses prioritization and A/B testing

Goal: Prioritize hypotheses prepared by online store marketers to increase revenue, run an A/B test, analyze the results and decide whether to continue the A/B test.  

Using online store data two hypotheses were selected from the list of 9, using ICE and RICE frameworks. Using data on visitors and orders A/B test was conducted and results were analysed. Cumulative revenue, average bill, and conversions by group were plotted. The statistical significance of differences in conversions and average bills was evaluated on the raw and cleaned data. Based on the analysis, it was decided to discontinue the test.   

Used libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`, `A/B testing`, `Hypotheses testing`
